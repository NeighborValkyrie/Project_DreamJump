LEVEL GEOMETRY PATTERNS
=======================

EGUTJUGUT (Mechanics Test):
  Platform Types:
    - Jump Pad (enhanced jumping)
    - Soft Jump (reduced impact)
    - Conveyer Belt (moving platform)
    - Slippery Surface (low friction)
    - Glass Platform (transparent)
    - Starting Lift (initial platform)
    - Ending Lift (final platform)

02_STAGE1 (Building Exploration):
  Structure:
    - 1st Building (main level container)
      - Roof
      - Section 1-5 (tutorial rooms)
    - Next Stage Floor (progression trigger)
  
  Design Pattern: Linear exploration through rooms

03_STAGE2 (Candy-Themed Platformer):
  Platform Types:
    - Candy Platforms (main walkable surfaces)
    - Bridges (connection points)
    - Cliffs (elevated areas)
    - Dynamic Floor (script-controlled)
  
  Hazards:
    - Water (4 sections)
    - Monster (boss enemy)
    - Ruins (obstacles)
  
  Special Elements:
    - WaffleBot (moving obstacle/enemy)
    - WaffleUp (elevator lift)
    - Collectibles (Candy items)


ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS OBSERVED
================================

1. SCENE ORGANIZATION
   - Root objects act as organizational containers
   - Systems kept separate from geometry
   - Managers are singleton root objects

2. PLAYER IMPLEMENTATION
   - Two variations: Full rig (egutjugut) vs simplified (03_Stage2)
   - Always includes main camera or virtual camera

3. UI ARCHITECTURE
   - Canvas-based UI system
   - Separate root for EventSystem
   - Canvases are root objects in gameplay scenes
   - Full panel hierarchy in menu scenes

4. LEVEL LAYOUT
   - Geometry organized into logical groups
   - Checkpoints/spawns as separate objects
   - Interactive elements as individual roots

5. SYSTEMS SEPARATION
   - Game logic (GameSystem, RespawnSystem)
   - Collections (BuffManager, CollectibleManager)
   - UI (EventSystem, Canvases)
   - World (Cameras, Lights, Geometry)


SCENE PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION
=============================

TEST/TUTORIAL SCENES:
  - egutjugut.unity
    Purpose: Test mechanics and systems
    Content: Interactive platforms, respawn system
    
  - minji.unity
    Purpose: Test UI and inventory
    Content: Menu system, inventory UI

PLAYABLE LEVELS:
  - 02_Stage1.unity
    Purpose: Tutorial/Introduction level
    Difficulty: Beginner
    Challenge: Simple navigation
    
  - 03_Stage2.unity
    Purpose: Main gameplay level
    Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced
    Challenge: Platforming, hazards, enemies


TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS
======================

GAMEOBJECT NAMING:
  - Descriptive names for most objects
  - Some generic names (Cube, Cube (1))
  - UI elements use hierarchical naming (ItemSlot_01, etc.)
  - Special characters in names ('RespawnSystem ', 'end lift ')

HIERARCHY DEPTH:
  - Average: 2-3 levels
  - egutjugut: Deeper (more interactive elements)
  - minji: Shallow (mostly UI)
  - 03_Stage2: Moderate (dense but organized)

COMPONENT USAGE:
  - Standard Unity components (Camera, Light, Canvas)
  - Custom MonoBehaviour scripts for systems
  - Animator on character models
  - Rigidbody for physics interaction
  - BoxCollider for collision/triggers


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NAVIGATION
===============================

1. TO UNDERSTAND GAME MECHANICS:
   - Study egutjugut.unity
   - Focus on RespawnSystem, GameSystem, BuffManager

2. TO UNDERSTAND UI SYSTEM:
   - Study minji.unity
   - Review InventoryPanel hierarchy

3. TO UNDERSTAND LEVEL STRUCTURE:
   - Study 03_Stage2.unity (complex)
   - Compare with 02_Stage1.unity (simple)

4. TO UNDERSTAND PLAYER IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Check Third Person Player in egutjugut.unity
   - Compare with Player in 03_Stage2.unity


INTEGRATION NOTES
=================

SHARED SYSTEMS:
  - Camera system (Main Camera in all scenes)
  - Lighting (Directional Light in all scenes)
  - EventSystem (UI event handling)

UNIQUE SYSTEMS:
  - RespawnSystem (egutjugut only)
  - InventorySystem (minji focused)
  - Enemy AI (03_Stage2 only)

PROGRESSION PATH:
  02_Stage1 -> 03_Stage2 -> (next levels)

TESTING SCENES:
  egutjugut, minji (support development)
