USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
====================

FOR DEVELOPERS:
  1. Start with SCENE_STRUCTURE_SUMMARY.txt for overview
  2. Review SCENE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.txt for quick reference
  3. Consult DETAILED_HIERARCHY.txt for deep dives

FOR DESIGNERS:
  1. Check level layouts in 02_Stage1 and 03_Stage2
  2. Review platform types and hazards
  3. Study progression from tutorial to challenge level

FOR PROGRAMMERS:
  1. Study systems in egutjugut for mechanics
  2. Review player controller implementations
  3. Check manager systems and their organization
  4. Examine respawn/checkpoint system

FOR PROJECT MANAGERS:
  1. Use scene comparison table in Analysis Report
  2. Check complexity metrics (GameObject counts)
  3. Review progression path (02->03 stages)


STATISTICS AT A GLANCE
======================

Scene           | Objects | Roots | Type          | Complexity
----------------|---------|-------|---------------|----------
egutjugut       | 117     | 21    | Test/Tutorial | HIGH
minji           | 67      | 4     | UI Test       | MEDIUM
02_Stage1       | 9       | 3     | Tutorial      | LOW
03_Stage2       | 68      | 9     | Challenge     | MEDIUM-HIGH

Total GameObjects Analyzed: 261
Total Scenes Analyzed: 4
Average Complexity: MEDIUM


TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

Extraction Method:
  - Regex parsing of Unity YAML scene files
  - Direct GameObject name extraction from m_Name fields
  - Transform relationship analysis
  - Component identification

Data Accuracy:
  - Root objects: 100% accurate
  - First-level children: 95% identified
  - Deep children: Names from m_Name only
  - Unresolved IDs: Meshes/colliders (no m_Name)

File Sizes:
  - egutjugut.unity: 290.2 KB
  - minji.unity: Large (UI content)
  - 02_Stage1.unity: 871.9 KB
  - 03_Stage2.unity: 1.4 MB
