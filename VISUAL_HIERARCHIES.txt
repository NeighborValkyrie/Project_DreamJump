QUICK OBJECT COUNT BY SCENE
============================

egutjugut:     117 GameObjects, 21 roots
minji:         67 GameObjects, 4 roots
02_Stage1:     9 GameObjects, 3 roots
03_Stage2:     68 GameObjects, 9 roots

Total:         261 GameObjects analyzed


KEY SYSTEMS MAPPING
===================

Core Systems (egutjugut only):
  RespawnSystem -> Manages: first respawn point, respawn
  GameSystem -> Orchestrates: All game logic
  BuffManager -> Manages: Status effects
  CollectibleManager -> Manages: Item collection

Player Implementation:
  egutjugut: Third Person Player (full skeletal rig)
  03_Stage2: Player (simplified controller)

Camera Systems:
  Standard: Main Camera (all scenes)
  Advanced: Cinemachine Camera (egutjugut)

UI Systems:
  egutjugut: Pause, Checkpoint, Collection, HUD
  minji: Extensive inventory (12 slots), Dialogue, Health
  02_Stage1: Minimal
  03_Stage2: Minimal

Lighting:
  Directional Light in all scenes
  egutjugut: Warm color temperature


SCENE PROGRESSION PATH
======================

Development/Testing Scenes:
  egutjugut -> Tutorial mechanics testing
  minji -> UI/menu system testing

Playable Campaign:
  02_Stage1 -> Tutorial Level (Introduction)
       |
       v
  03_Stage2 -> Challenge Level (Main Gameplay)
       |
       v
  (Future: Stage 4+)


PLATFORM TYPES BY SCENE
=======================

egutjugut (Testing):
  - Jump Pad (enhanced jumping)
  - Soft Jump (reduced impact)
  - Conveyer Belt (moving platform)
  - Slippery Surface (low friction)
  - Glass Platform (transparent)
  - Starting Lift (initial platform)
  - Ending Lift (final platform)

02_Stage1 (Tutorial):
  - Building sections (rooms)
  - Progression floor (next stage)

03_Stage2 (Challenge):
  - Candy platforms (main walkable)
  - Bridges (connectors)
  - Cliffs (elevated areas)
  - Dynamic floor (script-controlled)
  - Water hazards (4 sections)


ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS
======================

Scene Organization:
  All scenes: Cameras and lights at root
  Test scenes: Systems at root (managers)
  Level scenes: Geometry at root
  UI scene: Canvas-heavy hierarchy

GameObject Naming:
  Descriptive (jump pad, conveyer, Monster)
  Numbered (Candy (1), Section1-5)
  Generic (Cube, Cube (1))
  Special characters allowed ('RespawnSystem ')

Hierarchy Depth:
  Shallow (2-3 levels): Most scenes
  Deep (4+ levels): egutjugut, 03_Stage2
  Flat structure: minji (all UI at similar depth)
